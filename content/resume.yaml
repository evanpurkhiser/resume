      - heading: Product Engineering
        bullets:
          - >-
            Architected and launched the Uptime Monitoring product end-to-end
            from conception to production. Including a highly-concurrent Rust
            HTTP uptime checker, Python Kafka consumer, RDAP/WHOIS host
            association, and complete frontend product user experience.
          - >-
            Led multi-year evolution of Cron Monitoring product, processing 15MM+
            check-ins daily, architecting multiple Kafka-based lock-step timing
            sensitive consumers for distributed check-in processing with
            real-time synthetic "miss" and "timeout" detection, coupled with
            retrospective check-in volume anomaly analysis, to filter false
            positive alerts during internal upstream ingestion incidents.
          - >-
            Built Slack integration from ground up atop the integration
            platform, including message unfurling for Sentry issue links,
            interactive issue actions (assign/resolve/ignore/archive), DM
            support, and user identity linking. With rapid growth and is
            Sentry's most used integration.
          - >-
            Built GitHub, Bitbucket, and Jira integrations, for commit linking,
            stack trace source mapping, and issue syncing workflows.
          - >-
            Implemented a complete spec-compliant SAML2 integration generalized
            across multiple identity providers.
          - >-
            Rebuilt user onboarding experience from scratch with meticulous
            attention to frontend polish, micro-interactions, and delightful
            animations to create a joyful first impression of Sentry. Including
            A/B testing framework, comprehensive analytics tracking, and task
            completion system.

      - heading: Platform & Infrastructure
        bullets:
          - >-
            Architected an integrations platform enabling rapid development of
            third-party integrations, building core infrastructure for OAuth
            flows, provider configuration flows, feature gating, permissions
            management, and generalized frontend components.
          - >-
            Implemented node-canvas backend chart rendering service for email and
            Slack notifications, enabling shared rendering implementations between
            backend services and frontend chart components.
          - >-
            Implemented parsing expression grammar via PEG.js, producing
            fully-typed AST for incremental parsing of Sentry's custom event
            search syntax, with careful attention to DX enabling grammar
            reusability and maintainability, with proven reuse across multiple
            product surfaces.

      - heading: Technical Leadership & Modernization
        bullets:
          - >-
            Led Python 2→3 migration fixing thousands of compatibility issues
            across the entire monolith, correcting byte/string encoding, pickle
            serialization, and HTTP client usage for cross-version
            compatibility. Includes designing a slow-roll-out strategy for the
            migration.
          - >-
            Drove TypeScript adoption converting 500+ JavaScript files to
            TypeScript across all aspects of Sentry's frontend application.
          - >-
            Spearheaded Frontend testing modernization initiative migrating
            300+ test files from Enzyme to React Testing Library, establishing
            new testing patterns focused on user behavior over implementation
            details and improving test reliability across engineering
            organization.
          - >-
            Orchestrated comprehensive Frontend modernization across the
            monolith including routing infrastructure upgrade (React Router
            3→6), component architecture refactor (100 class components to
            hooks-based patterns), and build toolchain upgrades (Node.js,
            webpack, Babel, TypeScript) enabling code splitting and lazy
            loading, deployed zero-downtime via backward-compatible
            abstractions.
          - >-
            Reduced CI build time by 40% with a multi-stage GHA docker test
            image which caches unchanged dependencies.
      - heading: Organizational Impact
        bullets:
          - >-

            migration to TypeScript, organization-wide code quality initiatives,
            React modernizations, and testing infrastructure improvements
            across 7+ product teams.
          - >-
            Mentored engineers across teams on SDLC best practices, modern React
