          - >-
            Launched [Uptime
            Monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/product/uptime-monitoring/) from
            zero to GA, owning the entire architecture across a
            high-concurrency Rust checker, Kafka pipeline, Python processor,
            and React frontend; scaled to 100k+ customer monitors.
          - >-
            Led multi-year end-to-end ownership of [Cron
            Monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/), evolving it
            from early PoC to a highly reliable system processing 60M+ daily
            check-ins, including timing-sensitive processors, internal anomaly
            detection, and frontend user experience.
          - >-
            Built Slack Integration from ground up atop the integration
            platform. Becoming our most used integration, over 120k+ orgs.
          - >-
            Rebuilt onboarding experience with a heavy focus on clarity, polish, and
            micro-interactions. Creating strong first impressions.

      - heading: Platform Engineering
        bullets:
          - >-
            Designed and implemented a generalized integrations platform
            (OAuth, permissions, feature gating, UI primitives), unlocking
            rapid development of Slack, GitHub, Jira, Vercel, etc
            integrations.
          - >-
            Established a shared chart rendering pipeline across frontend and
            backend, enabling notification charts (email, Slack, etc) to reuse
            frontend code. Significantly reducing maintenance overhead and
            ensuring consistent presentation.
          - >-
            Reduced inconsistent frontend event search experiences by building
            a reusable, type-safe parsing grammar. Enabling incremental parsing
            and consistent behavior across UI surfaces, while improving
            developer ergonomics and maintainability.

          - >-
            Proactively led multi-year frontend modernization efforts to
            preempt scaling and maintainability risks. Areas included upgrading
            routing infrastructure (React Router 3→6), component architecture
            (class → functional), and testing strategy (Enzyme → React Testing
            Library). Enabling faster, safer iteration and higher engineering
            velocity across the organization.
          - >-
            Drove TypeScript adoption converting 500+ JavaScript files to
            TypeScript across all aspects of Sentry's frontend application.
